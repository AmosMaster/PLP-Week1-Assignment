I’m Amos Chauke, a Master Trainer with a non-degree professional certificate in IT Support and an ITE Cisco
Instructor. In 2019, I started my journey by volunteering at a local community center, where I immersed myself in
various programs and workshops to expand my knowledge and skills. Now, I’m passionate about giving back to
communities, schools, and organizations by sharing the expertise I’ve gained. My goal is to empower others
through education and upskilling.</p>
